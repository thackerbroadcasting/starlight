At this time, no. We’ll put you in our San Fransisco instance by default. At this time, there isn’t a way to scatter clients around data centers. We will, however, put a relay server in the data center closest to you and connect you to that to help minimize the delay and reduce buffering.

Keep in mind, this is subject to change in the future. We understand that while our customers remain close to home for the time being, expansion is inevitable. The current working structure is that clients will be placed in one of the closest data centers possible and will operate there until the client either moves or expands.
