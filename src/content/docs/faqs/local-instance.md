We try to provide you with the easiest possible solution to managing your tunes, which requires an internet connection. We will evaluate each individual request for an offline instance and reply to each based on circumstances. However, if you are approved an offline installation, a contract will be written that waives our liability for unauthorized access, system updates, system disruptions, and music management. If there are questions, please reach out to [contact@thackerbroadcasting.com](mailto:contact@thackerbroadcasting.com) or submit a ticket.
